My movie app built using React and Redux can be summarized as follows:

Home Page:

Displays the total number of movies and the user's favorite movie.
Allows users to search for and view movies.
Movie List:

Shows a list of movies with their names and the number of views.
Each movie has options for deletion and possibly other functionalities.
Category Selection:

Users can filter movies by all movies, popular movies, or the most viewed movies.
Add New Movie:

Allows users to add new movies by providing their name and the number of times they have been viewed.
Redux Integration:

Redux is used for state management, ensuring centralized control over the application's data and enabling automatic re-rendering whenever the state changes.
This project is designed to manage a movie database, implementing core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It features a user-friendly interface and effectively utilizes React components and Redux state management for seamless functionality.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
